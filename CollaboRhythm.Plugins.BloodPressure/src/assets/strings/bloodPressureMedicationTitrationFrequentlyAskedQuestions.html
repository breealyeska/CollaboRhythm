<p><b><font size="+18">Frequently Asked Questions</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="+12">What is hypertension / high blood pressure and what are the risks?</font></b><br/>Hypertension is a long-term (chronic) disease in which your blood pressure is high. This means that your heart has to work harder and that there is more stress on your arteries, the blood vessels that  carry blood from your heart to all of the parts of your body.<br/>The stress on your arteries causes damage over time and can lead to heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, eye disease, and other problems. The increased work on your heart can also lead to heart disease including heart attacks and heart failure.</p>
<br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">Why is it important to control my blood pressure? Why is it worth the effort?</font></b><br/>The
  risks of high blood pressure may seem scary, but you should not give up. It is all within your control. These risks only
  become real if you do not control your blood pressure. And they only become significant after years of poor blood pressure control.<br/>If you control your blood pressure, you can significantly
  decrease your risk. Control of blood pressure has been shown to be extremely effective at preventing complications. It  decreases the incidence of heart attack by 20-25%, of stroke by 35-40%, and of  heart failure by 50%. Every 10 mmHg decrease in your blood pressure leads to significant decreases in your risk.</p>
<br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What are the factors that affect blood pressure that I can control?</font></b><br/>Diet, exercise,
  and medication adherence are the most important factors that you can control in managing your blood
  pressure.<br/>In the long term, diet and exercise help you to achieve your ideal body weight. It is possible to decrease your blood pressure by 5-20 mmHg just by losing 20 pounds. Specifically adhering to a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and lowfat dairy products can help to reduce your blood pressure by 8-14 mmHg and reducing the amount of sodium in your diet can reduce your blood pressure by 2-8 mmHg. Limiting your consumption of alcohol to no more than two drinks a day can also reduce your blood pressure by 2-4 mmHg. In addition to the contribution of physical activity to weight loss, engaging in regular aerobic exercise such as brisk walking for 30 minutes a day can reduce your blood pressure by 4-9 mmHg. </p>
<br/>
  
<p><b><font size="+12">What is the aim of this study?</font></b><br/>The aim of this study is to help you to
  titrate (adjust) your blood pressure medications and improve your diet and exercise so that your blood pressure reaches goal as
  efficiently and as safely as possible.<br/>Typically, patients rely on clinicians (doctors and nurses)
  to make decisions about their blood pressure medications. The problem with this approach is that it requires many trips to
  the clinic and takes a long period of
  time. Also, since clinicians are making the decisions, patients often do not feel in control of their condition.<br/>The aim of this study is to help you learn how to manage your blood pressure with the help of your coaches. You will no longer be a patient being told what to do by clinicians. You
  will be an apprentice learning to
  become an expert in your hypertension care with the help of your coaches. This process will demand more of you, but you
  will get a lot of benefits in return. You will have all of the data about your hypertension care at your fingertips, and
  you will be able to communicate with your coaches through this app. You will not have to make visits to the clinic
  for most of your care, so you will not have to miss work or sit in a waiting room. You will gain skills that allow
  you to better manage your blood pressureand that you will be able to apply to other health issues that you face.</p>
<br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is the aim of this app?</font></b><br/>This app provides tools that will help you to become
	an expert in your hypertension care and blood pressure medication titration with the
	help of your coaches.<br/>The app lets you track all of your medications and blood pressure measurement easily. It
	also visualizes this
	information in a way that will make it easier for you to see the relationship between your medication adherence, diet, and exercise and your
	blood pressure measurements. It provides support to make it easier to make decisions about changes in your blood pressure medications, and it allows you to communicate with your coaches about your decisions.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What kind of communication does this app allow with my coaches?</font></b><br/>This app allows two
	main kinds of communication with your coaches: virtual visits and instant messages.<br/>Virtual visits are real-time
	(synchronous) communication sessions where you talk with your coaches like you would on
	the phone or on a video conference. In addition, during virtual visits you can control navigation on each other&rsquo;s
	screens and can point to things on each other&rsquo;s screens. These tools make it easier to talk about data that is
	important in blood pressure managment, and they make it easier to make decisions together.<br/>Instant messages are more
	like text messages or e-mails in that you send that at some time during the day, but you
	don&rsquo;t expect a response until your coach reads the message later in the day. Instant messages are valuable
	because you don&rsquo;t have to schedule a time to use them. You can ask your questions or provide information
	whenever it is pertinent. There are two types of instant messages. Text messages allow you to type what you want to
	say and video messages allow you to simply record what you want to say.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What should I expect during this study?</font></b><br/>The main portion of this study will last for three months. During that time, you will use this app in collaboration with your health coach.  Your goal is to get your blood pressure below the goal of 130/80 using the minimum number of medications by maximizing your medication adherence and improving your diet and exercise. Every two weeks, if your blood pressure has not reached the goal of less than 130/80, you will increase the dose of one of your blood pressure medications, or you will start a new medication. If you are able to reach goal blood pressure through taking your medications, improving your diet, and increasing your physical activity, you will be able to start decreasing your blood pressure medications every two weeks. After the initial three months, you will stop using this app and your blood pressure will be monitored as part of routine care to see how well you are able to continue to control your blood pressure.</p><br/>
  
<p><b><font size="+12">What is the hypertension medication titration protocol?</font></b><br/>The hypertension medication titration protocol is a simplified guide that suggests the series of medications that should should be added every two weeks to control your blood pressure. It was developed by a hypertension expert at the Massachusetts General Hospital. In this application, it has been visualized in the form of a subway map where each dose of each medication is another stop along the route to maximum medication therapy. As mentioned, if you reach your goal blood pressure, you can also decrease/remove medications during the course of the study.</p><br/>
  
<p><b><font size="+12">What is hypertensive urgency/emergency?</font></b><br/>If your blood pressure is very high, greater than 180/120, it is considered hypertensive urgency because of the risk of damage to your small blood vessels and the potential of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and even death. Hypertensive urgency is when your blood pressure is not only extremely elevated but when you also have symptoms suggestive of damage. You have been selected to participate in this study because you do not have a history of very high blood pressure. In addition, you will be working with your health coach to decrease your blood pressure, so your risk of hypertensive urgency/emergency is low. It is still possible, however, that you could develop very high blood pressure during the course of this study. </p>
<br/>
<p><b><font size="+12">What are the symptoms of hypertensive emergency?</font></b><br/>The symptoms of hypertensive emergency are different
in every person. They may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Headache</li>
  <li>Anxiety</li>
  <li>Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p><b><font size="+12">What should I do in the case of hypertensive urgency/emergency?</font></b><br/>Unlike the damage from moderately high blood
  pressure that takes place over years, the effects of hypertensive emergency can happen in a very short time. In the case that you have symptoms of hypertensive emergency, you should call the on-call number for the Ambulatory Practice of the Future (617-724-1100) immediately. In the case that your blood pressure is greater than 180/120 but you do not have symptoms, you should repreat your blood pressure. If it is still above 180/120, then you should call the on-call number for the Ambulatory Practice of the Future.</p>
<p><br/>
  <b><font size="+12">What is hypotension?</font></b><br/>
Hypotension is a condition that occurs when you blood
  pressure is too low. Just as your blood pressure can be too
  high, it can also be too low. If your blood pressure is not high enough, then your heart, brain, and other parts of your body may not get enough blood. Blood pressure less than 90/60 is generally considered to be hypotension.</p>
<br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What are some common causes of hypotension?</font></b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Taking too much of your high blood pressure medications or taking them too frequently</li>
	<li>Dehydration</li>
	<li>Other medications such as antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, painkillers, etc.</li>
	<li>Drinking alcohol</li>
</ul><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What are the symptoms of hypotension?</font></b><br/>The symptoms of hypotension are different
	in every person and vary depending on the degree of hypotension. They may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dizziness or light-headedness</li>
	<li>Fainting</li>
	<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
	<li>Blurry vision</li>
	<li>Nausea</li>
	<li>Cold/clammy skin</li>
	<li>Rapid/shallow breating</li>
	<li>Fatigue/tiredness/weakness</li>
	<li>Depression</li>
	<li>Significant thirst</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What should I do in the case of hypotension?</font></b><br/>Unlike the damage from high blood
	pressure that takes place over years, the effects of hypotension can be felt in
	minutes. In the case that you have symptoms of hypotension, you should call the on-call number for the Ambulatory Practice of the Future (617-724-1100) immediately. In the case that your blood pressure is less than 90/60 but you do not have symptoms, you should repeat your blood pressure. If it is still below 90/60, then you should call the on-call number for the Ambulatory Practice of the Future.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">How does this app help me to follow these  guidelines for hypertensive urgency/emergency and for hypotension?</font></b><br/>If your blood pressure is greater than 180/120 or less than 90/60, the app will ask you if you have any symptoms of hypertensive emergency or hypotension. If you do, it will instruct you to call the on-call number for the Ambulatory Practice of the Future. If you do not have any symptoms, it will prompt you to repeat your blood pressure measurement. If the measurement is still abnormal, it will instruct you to call the on-call number for the Ambulatory Practice of the Future. If your blood pressure is within normal limits, but you think that you have symptoms of hypertensive emergency or hypotension, you do not need to do anything with the app and you should call the on-call number for the Ambulatory Practice of the Future.</p>
