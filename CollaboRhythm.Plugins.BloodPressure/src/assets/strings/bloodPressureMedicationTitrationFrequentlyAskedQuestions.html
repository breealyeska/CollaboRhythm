<p><b><font size="+18">Frequently Asked Questions</font></b></p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is the aim of this study?</font></b><br/>The aim of this study is to help you to
	titrate your basal insulin so that your blood glucose reaches goal as
	efficiently and as safely as possible.<br/>Typically, patients rely on clinicians (doctors, nurses, and educators)
	to make decisions about their insulin titration. The problem with this approach is that it requires many trips to
	the clinic and takes a long period of
	time. Since clinicians are making the decisions, patients often do not learn how to manage their blood sugars on
	their own. Since clinicians are not available to patients all of the time, this can lead to gaps in care and poor
	outcomes for patients.<br/>The aim of this study is to help you learn how to manage your diabetes and insulin
	titration with the help of your coaches. You will no longer be a patient being told what to do by clinicians. You
	will be an apprentice learning to
	become an expert in your diabetes care with the help of your coaches. This process will demand more of you, but you
	will get a lot of benefits in return. You will have all of the data about your diabetes care at your fingertips, and
	you will be able to communicate with your coaches through this app. You will not have to make visits to the clinic
	for most of your care, so you will not have to miss work or sit in a waiting room. You will gain skills that allow
	you to better manage your diabetes and that you will be able to apply to other health issues that you face.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is the aim of this app?</font></b><br/>This app provides tools that will help you to become
	an expert in your diabetes care and insulin titration with the
	help of your coaches.<br/>The app lets you track all of your medications and blood glucose measurement easily. It
	also visualizes this
	information in a way that will make it easier for you to see the relationship between your medications and your
	blood glucose measurements. It provides support to make it easier to make decisions about changes in your insulin
	dose, and it allows you to communicate with your coaches about your decisions.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What kind of communication does this app allow with my coaches?</font></b><br/>This app allows two
	main kinds of communication with your coaches: virtual visits and instant messages.<br/>Virtual visits are real-time
	(synchronous) communication sessions where you talk with your coaches like you would on
	the phone or on a video conference. In addition, during virtual visits you can control navigation on each other&rsquo;s
	screens and can point to things on each other&rsquo;s screens. These tools make it easier to talk about data that is
	important in insulin titration, and they make it easier to make decisions together.<br/>Instant messages are more
	like text messages or e-mails in that you send that at some time during the day, but you
	don&rsquo;t expect a response until your coach reads the message later in the day. Instant messages are valuable
	because you don&rsquo;t have to schedule a time to use them. You can ask your questions or provide information
	whenever it is pertinent. There are two types of instant messages. Text messages allow you to type what you want to
	say and video messages allow you to simply record what you want to say.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What should I expect during this study?</font></b><br/>This study will last for three months. Your
	role as an apprentice in your diabetes care will progress through three
	stages as you become an expert.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In stage 1, you will connect with your coaches through virtual visits using this app. Your coaches will walk you
		through decisions and teach you how they think about insulin titration. This stage will last a week or two. The
		length of this stage is flexible based on your level of comfort with progressing.
	</li>
	<li>In stage 2, you will still connect with your coaches through virtual visits using this app, but your coaches
		will encourage you to lead the decision making process. They will provide assistance when you need it, but their
		goal will be to encourage your independence. This stage will last a week or two as well.
	</li>
	<li>In stage 3, you will simply make your decisions on your own using this app and you will send instant messages to
		your coaches. Your coaches will send you instant messages back to answer your questions and to provide advice.
	</li>
</ul><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is diabetes?</font></b><br/>Diabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease in which there are high
	levels of glucose (a building block of sugar) in
	the blood.<br/>When you eat food, it is broken down into a number of components including glucose. Glucose is a
	source of fuel for the body, and it travels through the blood to all of your organs.<br/>Insulin is a hormone that
	is made by an organ called the pancreas. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the
	blood into muscle, fat, and the liver, where it can be used as fuel.<br/>People with diabetes have high levels of
	glucose in the blood because their pancreas does not make enough insulin
	(usually in type 1 diabetes) or because the cells in their body do not respond normally to insulin (usually in type
	2 diabetes).</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is Type 2 diabetes?</font></b><br/>Type 2 diabetes makes up most of diabetes cases. The
	biggest risk factor for type 2 diabetes is obesity. Being obese
	makes the cells of the body less sensitive to insulin and leads to high levels of glucose in the blood. It usually
	occurs in adulthood, but it is not being diagnosed in teens and young adults because of high obesity rates around
	the world.<br/>It is possible to have type 2 diabetes even if you are not obese. The cause is typically still due to
	the cells of
	the body being less sensitive to insulin.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What are the risks of having high blood glucose?</font></b><br/>High levels of blood glucose cause
	gradual damage to the cells of the body, especially to small blood vessels that
	supply important parts of the body. After many years, this can lead to serious problems. These problems are
	compounded by the fact that high blood glucose can make it harder to control your blood pressure and
	cholesterol.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Eyes: You can have trouble seeing (especially at night) and you can develop light sensitivity. In severe cases,
		you can become blind.
	</li>
	<li>Heart: You can have a heart attack.</li>
	<li>Brain: You can have a stroke.</li>
	<li>Skin: You can develop sores and infections, especially on your feet. In severe cases, your foot or leg may have
		to be removed.
	</li>
	<li>Nerves: You can develop nerve damage, which leads to pain, tingling, or loss of feeling. You could have problems
		digesting food or going to the bathroom. Men can have difficulty getting an erection.
	</li>
	<li>Kidneys: Your kidneys may not work as well at eliminating toxins from your body. In severe cases, they may even
		stop working.
	</li>
</ul><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">Why is it important to control my blood glucose? Why is it worth the effort?</font></b><br/>The
	risks of diabetes may seem scary, but you should not give up. It is all within your control. These risks only
	become real if you do not control your blood glucose. And they only become significant after years of poor blood glucose control.<br/>If you control your blood glucose, you can significantly
	decrease your risk of the complications listed above. If
	you work hard at your diabetes early, you can even eliminate your diabetes and these associated risks. The longer
	you wait, the more difficult it becomes to manage your blood glucose.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What are the factors that affect blood glucose that I can control?</font></b><br/>Diet, exercise,
	and medication adherence are the most important factors that you can control in managing your blood
	glucose.<br/>In the long term, diet and exercise help you to achieve your ideal body weight. This helps to make your
	body more
	sensitive to insulin so that it can manage your blood glucose effectively without you thinking about it.<br/>In the
	short term, a diet low in carbohydrates (complex sugars) and sugar will help to manage your blood glucose
	because less glucose will enter your blood. In addition, exercise will increase the demand for glucose as fuel for
	your muscles and will drive down the levels in your blood.<br/>Medications that you take by mouth for diabetes
	typically work by helping your pancreas to create more insulin or by
	making the cells of your body more sensitive to insulin. Taking these medications reliably (adherence) helps your
	body to manage your blood glucose level.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is hypoglycemia?</font></b><br/>Hypoglycemia is a condition that occurs when you blood
	glucose is too low. Just as your blood glucose can be too
	high, it can also be too low. Since glucose is an important fuel for your body, if there is not enough glucose, then
	the body begins to have trouble working properly. Blood glucose below 70 mg/dL is considered to be hypoglycemia.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What are some common causes of hypoglycemia?</font></b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time</li>
	<li>Taking too much insulin or diabetes medicine by mistake</li>
	<li>Not eating enough during meals or snacks after you have taken insulin or diabetes medicine</li>
	<li>Skipping meals</li>
	<li>Waiting to eat your meals</li>
	<li>Exercising more or at a different time than usual</li>
	<li>Drinking alcohol</li>
</ul><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia?</font></b><br/>The symptoms of hypoglycemia are different
	in every person. In addition, they are not very specific, meaning that you
	may have these symptoms for reasons other than hypoglycemia. They may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Double vision or blurry vision</li>
	<li>Fast or pounding heartbeat</li>
	<li>Feeling cranky or acting aggressive</li>
	<li>Feeling nervous</li>
	<li>Headache</li>
	<li>Hunger</li>
	<li>Shaking or trembling</li>
	<li>Sleeping trouble</li>
	<li>Sweating</li>
	<li>Tingling or numbness of the skin</li>
	<li>Tiredness or weakness</li>
	<li>Unclear thinking</li>
</ul><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What should I do in the case of hypoglycemia?</font></b><br/>Unlike the damage from high blood
	glucose that takes place over years, the effects of hypoglycemia can be felt in
	minutes. At the same time, the effects of hypoglycemia can be treated immediately.<br/>In the case of hypoglycemia,
	you should follow these steps, called a hypoglycemia action plan:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If your blood glucose is below 70 mg/dL or if you are worried that your blood glucose is too low based on
		symptoms, eat 15g of simple carbs. (½ cup of fruit juice, ½ cup of soda (non-diet), or 4 glucose tablets for
		example).  If your blood glucose is below 60 mg/dL or if you have severe symptoms of hypoglycemia, eat 30g of
		simple carbs. (1 cup of fruit juice, 1 cup of soda (non-diet), or 8 glucose tablets, for example).
	</li>
	<li>Wait 15 minutes.</li>
	<li>Recheck your blood glucose.</li>
	<li>If your blood glucose is below 90 mg/dL, return to step 1 with a cutoff of 90 mg/dL instead of 70 mg/dL.
		Otherwise proceed to step 5.
	</li>
	<li>If you plan to eat within 1 hour, eat 15g of complex carbs. (6 saltine crackers, for example) If you do not plan
		to eat within 1 hour, eat 30g of complex carbs. (1 peanut butter sandwich, for example)
	</li>
</ul><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">How does this app help me to follow the hypoglycemia action plan?</font></b><br/>If your blood glucose is below 70 mg/dL, the app will walk you through each of the steps of the hypoglycemia action
	plan. It will show you pictures of each of the foods that you may choose to eat, and it will automatically track the
	time between rechecking your blood glucose for you.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is basal insulin?</font></b><br/>Basal insulin is a kind of artificial insulin that patients
	take once a day to control their blood glucose. It stays
	in the body at a relatively constant concentration (level) throughout the day, so that it is constantly working to
	control blood glucose in a predictable manner.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is basal insulin titration?</font></b><br/>When taking basal insulin, it is necessary to
	gradually adjust the dose until your blood glucose in under control.
	This gradual adjustment to goal is called titration. Your dose needs to be adjusted gradually to prevent your blood
	glucose from dropping too rapidly or too low (hypoglycemia).</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is the 303 protocol?</font></b><br/>The 303 protocol is one of many simplified guides for
	titrating basal insulin. It requires that you take your fasting
	(before eating) blood glucose every morning. Every 3 days, you average your last 3 fasting blood glucose
	measurements. If the average is less than 80 mg/dL, you should reduce your insulin dose by 3 Units. If the average
	is between 80 and 110 mg/dL, you should keep your dose the same. If the average is above 110 mg/dL, you should
	increase your dose by 3 Units.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">How do I follow the 303 protocol if  I miss taking my fasting blood glucose one day?</font></b><br/>Having 3 fasting blood
	glucose measurements over 3 days is important before adjusting your dose of blood glucose
	because the average gives a good estimate of your baseline blood glucose and because it gives time for your body to
	adjust to the new dose of insulin. If you miss taking your fasting blood glucose one day, you should generally wait
	until you have 3 fasting blood glucose measurements since you last change in insulin dose before calculating your
	average blood glucose and adjusting your insulin dose. Only the first fasting measurement from each day counts because taking them
	all in one day will not give your body time to adjust to the new dose of insulin before making another change. In
	addition, all 3 measurements must be taken within the past 4 days, and 1 measurement must be taken on the day of
	making the change in dose. The reason that the measurements must be this recent is because older measurements are
	not a good reflection of your baseline blood glucose.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is the advantage of the 303 protocol?</font></b><br/>The main advantage of the 303 protocol
	is that it is relatively simple compared to other protocols. This makes is
	easier to teach and easier to follow.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">What is the disadvantage of the 303 protocol?</font></b><br/>The main disadvantage of the 303
	protocol is that, because it is so simple, it does not capture many of the other
	important factors that should be considered in titrating basal insulin efficiently and safely.</p>
<ul>
	<li>It does not account for your diet. Since what you eat affects your blood glucose, you need to take what you have
		eaten and what you will eat into account when you make decisions about your insulin dose.
	</li>
	<li>It does not account for your level of activity/exercise. Since exercise affects you blood glucose, you need to
		take into account how much you plan to exercise when you make decisions about your insulin dose. Increasing your
		dose when you plan to exercise a lot on a given day may lead to hypoglycemia.
	</li>
	<li>It does not account for your medication adherence. Whether or not you have taken your insluin and your other
		diabetes medications significantly affects your blood glucose measurements. For example, if you have not taken
		your medications in the last day, your blood glucose will be much higher. If you then increase your insulin dose
		and take your medications, then your blood glucose will drop significantly and may lead to hypoglycemia.
	</li>
	<li>It does not account for variability in your blood glucose measurements but only the average. For example, your
		most recent blood glucose measurement is more important than one three days ago because it is a better
		reflection of the state of your body today, but the protocol does not account for this factor.
	</li>
</ul><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">How should I think about using the 303 protocol?</font></b><br/>You should think about the 303
	protocol as a simple guide for your decisions. Since it does not account for all of
	the important factors in titrating basal insulin, you should not feel that you have to follow it all of the time. As
	you will learn, your coaches will not always follow the 303 protocol. They will teach you how to make good decisions
	about your insulin dose using the protocol as a guide but taking into account the other important factors mentioned
	above.</p><br/>

<p><b><font size="+12">How does this app help me use the 303 protocol as a guide?</font></b><br/>This app makes it easier
	to use the 303 protocol as a guide because it organizes all of your blood glucose
	measurements for you and beaks down the 303 protocol into 4 simple steps.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Observe average – The app automatically calculates the average of your 3 fasting blood glucose measurements
		since your last change in insulin dose. If you do not have 3 fasting blood glucose measurements yet, it will let
		you know.
	</li>
	<li>Consider protocol – The app shows the cutoffs of the 303 protocol (80 mg/dL and 110 mg/dL) so that you can see
		where your average blood glucose falls. It also highlights the change in dose recommended by the protocol on
		this graph.
	</li>
	<li>Decide change – The app respects that fact that the 303 protocol is only a simple guide and that it does not
		account for all of the factors that are important in deciding how to titrate your basal insulin. As a result, it
		does not require that you follow the recommendation of the 303 protocol. It lets you choose the change in dose
		that you think is most appropriate.
	</li>
	<li>Send message – A major aim of this app is to improve communication between you and your coach. Your coach
		gradually helps you learn how to make good decisions about your insulin titration. The app automatically sends
		messages to your coach when you make changes in your dose so that you can get helpful feedback.
	</li>
